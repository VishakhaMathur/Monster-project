# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

I have created an artwork consisting of an ocean monster using p5.js. It is combination of bat and butterfly elements. The scene is set in the middle of the ocean during the night with glowing moon, stars scattered over the sky, stones in the left corner of the sea and a ship being sailed. The moving monster is red in color with two legs, horns, wings and is meant to protect good sailors from destructive pirates. It is moving using the framecount, it also releases water circles towards the pirates in order to attack them. 

This is a work of art because it is a fusion of coding and storytelling. Various shapes, dynamic movement and interaction provided by p5.js depicts the scene visually appealing. The entire scenario displays a mythical narrative. By blending the features of bat and a butterfly, the monster in the scene shows dichotomy, aggression, protection and danger. This engaging artwork, where monster  fights against the pirates symbolises bravery that brings viewers to explore depth and quality of a digital art.
